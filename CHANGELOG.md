## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Dark theme: CSS variable toggle in gear dropdown; `localStorage` persistence;
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark` applied via inline `<head>` script before hydration.
- Background parallax: `WallpaperParallax` component — `pointermove` ±20 px,
  scroll ±90 px, RAF-throttled; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
- English locale: complete `en/` i18n dictionary; locale switcher in header;
  `Accept-Language` auto-detect on first visit.
- Multi-currency support: `currency` column on items (RUB/USD/EUR/GBP/CNY);
  `preferredCurrency` user profile field; prices display with correct symbol
  on dashboard, share page, and reservations.
- In-app notification system: bell icon with unread badge; dropdown with five
  most recent unread items and "Mark all as read"; `/notifications` page.
  Types: `item_updated`, `item_deleted`, `reservation_created`,
  `reservation_cancelled`, `owner_updated`. Static `shareToken` snapshot per
  notification; scroll-to-item highlight on nav. Badge polls every 30 s.
- Owner can cancel another user's reservation from the dashboard; reserver
  receives a `reservation_cancelled` notification.
- Reservation status from other users hidden on owner's dashboard by default;
  opt-in toggle in Settings ("Wishlist privacy"). `show_reservations_on_dashboard`
  boolean column on `users` (default false).
- Deleting the last remaining wishlist is allowed; a fresh default "Мой список"
  is created automatically.
- Wishlist names are unique per user: duplicate or empty name returns an inline
  error in create and rename forms.
- Dashboard and share page auto-refresh every 30 s via shared `AutoRefresh`
  component; selected wishlist id persisted in `localStorage`.

### Changed
- Site header: removed `backdrop-filter: blur`; background opacity raised to 0.92.
- Mobile header: logo hidden at ≤ 479 px.
- Invalid share page uses the same layout and styles as the 404 page.
- Form field errors unified across all user-facing forms: inline `ui-note-error`
  below the field, `ui-input-error` red border, focus on error.
- Settings form migrated from URL-param redirect to `useActionState`; URL stays
  clean; save button shows inline success/error feedback.

### Fixed
- Wallpaper background: migrated to a real `<div class="wallpaper-bg">` with
  direct `style.transform`; eliminates GPU compositing flicker on mobile during
  RSC reconciliation.
- `owner_updated` notification fires only when bio actually changes.
- `reservation_created`/`reservation_cancelled` not sent for owner's own wishes.
- Notifications page mobile layout: column at ≤ 479 px; icon-only nav buttons.
- Notification dropdown right-aligned on mobile (≤ 479 px).
- Status strip on `/reservations` always uses blue self-reserved style.
- Cancel reservation button on share page uses red danger style.
- Scroll-to-item standardized (block: center + highlight animation) across new
  item creation, edit save, and notification nav; shared `scrollAndHighlight()`
  utility in `scroll-utils.ts`.
- Price input hint renders below the field; color uses `--color-error` in dark mode.
- Long emails truncated with ellipsis on settings page; share page shows local
  part only with full address in tooltip.
- Mobile header no longer overflows horizontally at ≤ 479 px.
- Notification badge no longer shows stale count after visiting `/notifications`.
- `AutoRefresh` now skips `router.refresh()` when `document.hidden` is true,
  preventing aborted RSC requests (ECONNRESET) when a browser tab is closed or
  another context is torn down during e2e tests.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Self-reservation: owners can reserve and cancel their own items from the
  dashboard and the share page; self-reserved items are visually distinct.
- Item starring: star toggle marks favourite items; starred items sort to the
  top on the dashboard and share page, with a read-only star badge for
  gift-givers. Star can also be set at creation time via the create-item form.
- Account settings page (`/settings`): email display and «О себе» bio
  textarea; bio is shown on the share page to authenticated visitors.
- Header account menu: gear icon with account email, Settings link, and
  logout; replaces the standalone logout button. Owner email is also shown
  in the share page title area for all visitors.
- Multiple wishlists: owners can create, rename, and delete named wishlists;
  a dropdown selector switches between them instantly with no page reload.
  Each wishlist has an independent share link; the last wishlist cannot be
  deleted. A default «Мой список» is created automatically on registration.
- Brand label "WSHKA" added above the page title on all content pages.
- Price input field shows live formatting while typing: thousands are
  separated by a non-breaking space and the currency symbol (₽) appears
  inline right after the digits (e.g. `3 490 ₽`). The server strips
  formatting before parsing so existing validation is unaffected.
- Item create and edit forms auto-collapse on success; the page scrolls to
  the action buttons row. On create, scroll targets the newly added card
  regardless of its position (starred items land at the top, unstarred at
  the bottom).
- Deleting an item removes it from the list immediately without a background
  refresh, so the decorative background stays stable.

### Fixed
- Share page item cards now match the dashboard layout: colored status strip,
  unified card body, and consistent button style.
- Reservation on the share page no longer causes a full-page reload; the
  result is shown inline via `useActionState` + `router.refresh()`.
- After logging in from a share page, users are redirected back to the share
  page they came from. The login link passes `?next=/share/<token>` and
  `loginAction` honours it.
- Cancelling a reservation on `/reservations` no longer causes a full-page
  reload; the card disappears inline.
- Confirmation dialogs have side margins on narrow viewports via
  `min(24rem, calc(100% - 2 * var(--space-4)))`.
- Opening the item edit form scrolls to the action buttons row (Edit /
  Reserve / Delete) without triggering auto-focus, so the browser chrome
  stays visible on mobile.
- Share page title changed from "Публичный вишлист" to "Вишлист"; the list
  is link-shared, not openly public.
- `/settings` added to `robots.txt` Disallow and gets `noindex` meta tag.
  Auth pages (`/login`, `/register`, `/reservations`) removed from
  `robots.txt` Disallow so Googlebot can crawl them and honour their
  existing `noindex` meta tags.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Technical SEO baseline: page-level `<title>` and `<meta description>` for
  all routes; `robots.txt` with noindex for auth and private pages; `sitemap.xml`
  covering public routes; branded OG image (1200 × 630) via `next/og`.
- JSON-LD `WebApplication` structured-data script on the landing page.
- Dynamic share-page metadata: page title and description reflect the wishlist
  item count with correct Russian pluralization; always noindexed.
- App favicons: `icon.png` (32 × 32) and `apple-icon.png` (180 × 180)
  converted from the existing `icon.svg`.
- Unit tests for `formatPrice`: seven cases covering thousands separators,
  rounding, and zero.
- Unit tests for wishlist item validation: URL-without-protocol normalisation,
  `MAX_PRICE` boundary acceptance and rejection, zero price acceptance.
- Unit test for JSON-LD rendering on the unauthenticated landing page.

### Changed
- Owner dashboard, create-item form, delete-item button, and regenerate-link
  button now use `useActionState` + `startTransition(() => router.refresh())`
  instead of redirect-based status URLs, eliminating full-page reloads after
  mutations.
- Edit-item form uses `formRef` + `form.reset()` (driven by `updatedAt` change
  after RSC refresh) instead of key-based DOM re-mount; prevents stale field
  values and flicker after save.
- Inline success/error notifications scroll into view on success via
  `scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start" })`.
- Dashboard component files grouped into `src/app/_dashboard/` using Next.js
  private-folder convention; no routing changes.
- Deleted empty barrel files `src/modules/item/` and `src/modules/ui/`
  (contained only `export {}`).

### Fixed
- Edited note reverted to old text after save when RSC refreshed before the
  form re-mounted with new data.
- UI flicker on item create / delete / regenerate-link caused by unguarded
  `router.refresh()` calls outside `startTransition`.
- E2e tests updated to match inline-state flow: removed assertions for
  `?status=item-created` / `?status=item-updated` query parameters that no
  longer exist after the redirect removal.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

  design token system, wallpaper background.

  `<details>/<summary>`, and share link block.

  navigation block.

- Price display with Ruble symbol (₽) and per-line layout for price and URL.
- GitHub repository link in footer; version badge links to `/roadmap`.
- Project structure reorganized: tool configs moved to `config/`, docs to
  `docs/`, Dockerfile moved to `ops/`.

### Changed
- Owner dashboard and reservations page moved from `/app` and
  `/app/reservations` to `/` and `/reservations`.
- `RegisterUserResult` success now includes `userId` for auto-login.
- Logout action redirects to `/` instead of `/login?status=logged-out`.
- `npm run dev` clears `.next` before starting to prevent conflicts with
  production build artifacts.
- `compose.yaml` updated to reference `ops/Dockerfile`.
- `tsconfig.json` excludes `config/` directory instead of individual root files.

### Fixed
- Drizzle config paths resolve correctly relative to CWD when config is in
  `config/` subdirectory.
- E2e logout test waits for guest state before checking protected route
  redirect, removing a race condition.
