# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows SemVer.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Share page item cards now match the dashboard layout: colored status strip
  (green = available, purple = reserved), unified card body, and `item-reserve-btn`
  button style.
- Reservation on the share page no longer causes a full-page reload; the result
  (success or error) is shown inline using `useActionState` and `router.refresh()`,
  consistent with the dashboard mutation pattern.

### Added
- Self-reservation: owners can reserve and cancel their own items from the
  dashboard and the share page; self-reserved items are visually distinct.
- Item starring: star toggle marks favourite items; starred items sort to the
  top on the dashboard and share page, with a read-only star badge for
  gift-givers.
- Account settings page (`/settings`): email display and «О себе» bio
  textarea; bio is shown on the share page to authenticated visitors.
- Header account menu: gear icon with account email, Settings link, and
  logout; replaces the standalone logout button. Owner email is also shown
  in the share page title area for all visitors.
- Multiple wishlists: owners can create, rename, and delete named wishlists;
  a dropdown selector switches between them instantly with no page reload.
  Each wishlist has an independent share link; the last wishlist cannot be
  deleted. A default «Мой список» is created automatically on registration.
- Brand label "WSHKA" added above the page title on all content pages.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Technical SEO baseline: page-level `<title>` and `<meta description>` for
  all routes; `robots.txt` with noindex for auth and private pages; `sitemap.xml`
  covering public routes; branded OG image (1200 × 630) via `next/og`.
- JSON-LD `WebApplication` structured-data script on the landing page.
- Dynamic share-page metadata: page title and description reflect the wishlist
  item count with correct Russian pluralization; always noindexed.
- App favicons: `icon.png` (32 × 32) and `apple-icon.png` (180 × 180)
  converted from the existing `icon.svg`.
- Unit tests for `formatPrice`: seven cases covering thousands separators,
  rounding, and zero.
- Unit tests for wishlist item validation: URL-without-protocol normalisation,
  `MAX_PRICE` boundary acceptance and rejection, zero price acceptance.
- Unit test for JSON-LD rendering on the unauthenticated landing page.

### Changed
- Owner dashboard, create-item form, delete-item button, and regenerate-link
  button now use `useActionState` + `startTransition(() => router.refresh())`
  instead of redirect-based status URLs, eliminating full-page reloads after
  mutations.
- Edit-item form uses `formRef` + `form.reset()` (driven by `updatedAt` change
  after RSC refresh) instead of key-based DOM re-mount; prevents stale field
  values and flicker after save.
- Inline success/error notifications scroll into view on success via
  `scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start" })`.
- Dashboard component files grouped into `src/app/_dashboard/` using Next.js
  private-folder convention; no routing changes.
- Deleted empty barrel files `src/modules/item/` and `src/modules/ui/`
  (contained only `export {}`).

### Fixed
- Edited note reverted to old text after save when RSC refreshed before the
  form re-mounted with new data.
- UI flicker on item create / delete / regenerate-link caused by unguarded
  `router.refresh()` calls outside `startTransition`.
- E2e tests updated to match inline-state flow: removed assertions for
  `?status=item-created` / `?status=item-updated` query parameters that no
  longer exist after the redirect removal.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Full UI redesign: global header and footer with navigation, sticky layout,
  design token system, wallpaper background.

  `<details>/<summary>`, and share link block.
- Home page redesigned with hero section, features section, and dev-only
  navigation block.
- Auth pages redesigned with centered card layout.

- Reservations page redesigned with compact cards and cancel flow.
- `/roadmap` page with vertical timeline and milestone status indicators.
- `/not-found` (404) styled page.

- Auto-login after successful registration — session created immediately,
  no separate login step required.
- Logout redirects to home page instead of login page.
- Price display with Ruble symbol (₽) and per-line layout for price and URL.
- GitHub repository link in footer; version badge links to `/roadmap`.
- Project structure reorganized: tool configs moved to `config/`, docs to
  `docs/`, Dockerfile moved to `ops/`.

### Changed
- Owner dashboard and reservations page moved from `/app` and
  `/app/reservations` to `/` and `/reservations`.
- `RegisterUserResult` success now includes `userId` for auto-login.
- Logout action redirects to `/` instead of `/login?status=logged-out`.
- `npm run dev` clears `.next` before starting to prevent conflicts with
  production build artifacts.
- `compose.yaml` updated to reference `ops/Dockerfile`.
- `tsconfig.json` excludes `config/` directory instead of individual root files.

### Fixed
- Drizzle config paths resolve correctly relative to CWD when config is in
  `config/` subdirectory.
- E2e logout test waits for guest state before checking protected route
  redirect, removing a race condition.
